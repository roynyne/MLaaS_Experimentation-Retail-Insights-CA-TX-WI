Sales Revenue Prediction and Forecasting
==============================

Experiments pertaining to the development of forecasting and predictive models for the purpose of analysing and projecting sales income for a retail organisation having locations in Wisconsin (WI), Texas (TX), and California (CA) are included in this repository. The models will be made available as production-ready APIs.

**Project Overview**

The project aims to:

Create a prediction model to forecast sales income for a certain item in a particular retailer on a given date by utilising machine learning methods (XGBoost, Ridge).
Create a forecasting model to project the total sales income for all retailers over the following seven days using time-series analysis methods (ARIMA, Prophet).
